        <h1>Front End Developer Assessment</h1>
        <p>This project is designed to be a quick but realistic example of front-end web challenges we deal with, and a way for you to show us how you go about working with those challenges.</p>

          <h1>The Requirements</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>The site must be responsive. The client wants to support a wide range of devices.</li>
            <li>The product catalog should be retrieved from Mission Bicycle's product catalog service. This service can be accessed via a GET request to http://seq-front-end-assessment.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/catalog.json. This JSON file should contain all product information and images associated with products.</li>
            <li>The client wishes to use Googles <em>Montserrat</em> and <em>Playfair Display</em> web fonts.</li>
            <li><em>Font Awesome</em> web fonts should be used for iconography.</li>
            <li>All code should be checked into a git repository. Bitbucket or Github will work.</li>

        <h1>Expectations</h1>
        <p>We do not expect you to spend more than a couple of hours on this. Get as far as you can within a couple of hours and share your git repository with us.</p>
        <p>Our intent is to see how you go about setting up the project. How you structure the project and what tools do you choose to use for example. This will help us get an idea on how you work and will provide us with talking points during our interview.</p>
